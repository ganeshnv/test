I'm writing to inform you of my resignation from Senior Tech Associate at BoA.

I have decided to pursue another opportunity in a different career field. I have been very fortunate to be given many opportunities to learn useful skills during my time at BoA.

Please accept this letter as formal notice of my resignation and initiate further process.
